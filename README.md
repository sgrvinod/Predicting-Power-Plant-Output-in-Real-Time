# Predicting-Power-Plant-Output-in-Real-Time
Linear Regression Algorithm to predict output in a combined cycle power-plant using real-time pressure, temperature, humidity and exhaust vacuum sensor data. Achieved a standard error of 3 MW. 

**Modeled in Matlab.**

*Note: This is a first principles, hardcoded implementation of linear regression I wrote in Matlab.*
